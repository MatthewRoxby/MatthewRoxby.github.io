                    Hi! I'm Matthew, and I make games under the Pseudonym Nitricswight!

                    I've been making games of all sorts ever since I first picked up Scratch at age 7. Since then, I've tried my hand at several game engines and become adept at over five programming languages. And I've also prototyped a ton of impressive and fun games!
